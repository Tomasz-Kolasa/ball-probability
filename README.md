# ball-probability

<h2>Generally</h2>

<p>An app that calculates the probability of pulling out a ball specific colour from the bag filled with balls.</p>
<br>
<h2>To be more specific...</h2>

<p>First you put in the Bag any colour Balls (or you can fill the bag with a random set of balls).</p>

<p>Then you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>check the bag content, i.e. check how many balls of each colour are in the bag</li>
<li>check the probability of pulling out a ball specified colour from the bag, eg. red</li>
<li>check what is the most probable ball colour which will be take out next</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Worth to notice</h2>
<p>This is my first attempt of creating an app interface in python (or to code anything in python actually :))</p>
